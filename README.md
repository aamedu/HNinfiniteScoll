# hn-ng2

Hacker News made with [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).

I created this to see what it's like to create an AngularJS 2.0 application. I've previously experimented creating a [Hacker News clone with AngularJS 1](https://github.com/hswolff/hn-ng) so this was fun to play with.

Uses:
- [angularjs2](https://angular.io/)
- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
- [babeljs](http://babeljs.io/)

Made possible thanks to [shuhei](https://github.com/shuhei)'s work getting [AngularJS 2 to work with webpack and babeljs.](https://github.com/shuhei/babel-angular2-app) Thank you!

Also a lot of inspiration and example API usages taken from blacksonic's  [angular2-es6-todomvc](https://github.com/blacksonic/angular2-es6-todomvc) and [angular2-es6-starter](https://github.com/blacksonic/angular2-es6-starter).

## Todo

- [ ] Actually use Firebase's life updating and propogate those changes in the UI.
- [x] Dynamically load templates to achieve. Desire is to be able to do this:
  `<div ng-include="'/components/hn-item/hn-item--' + (data.type || 'story') + '.html'" />`
- [ ] Pre-warm the template cache for production builds.
- [ ] Create and register new pipes (filters) for components.
- [x] User angular-router 2 when it's available.
- [ ] The angular2 equivalent for `ng-bind-html`
- [x] How to create same `@Component` `properties` keys and values. So that I can have:
   ```javascript
   @Component({
     properties: {
       itemId: 'itemId',
     }
   })
   ```
- [x] Implement recursive `<hn-items />` so we can render comment trees.
